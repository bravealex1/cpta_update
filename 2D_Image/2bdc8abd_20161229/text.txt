The liver has normal echogenicity and size. In the left hepatic lobe, and linear areas of echogenicity may reflect pneumobilia. There is no evidence of intrahepatic ductal dilation. The common bile duct is borderline dilated for patient age, measuring 5 mm. The gallbladder contains gallstones versus tumefactive sludge. There is mild gallbladder wall thickening measuring 3 mm in thickness. The patient was not focally tender over the gallbladder. A trace amount of pericholecystic fluid is noted. The portal vein is patent with normal hepatopetal flow. There is borderline prominence of the main pancreatic duct, measuring 3 mm. The pancreas is otherwise unremarkable. The right kidney demonstrate moderate hydronephrosis with a ureteric stent partially visualized. This is better seen on concurrent renal ultrasound.
