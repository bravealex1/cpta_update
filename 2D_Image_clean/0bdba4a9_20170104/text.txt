The liver is normal in size, measuring 13.2 cm in maximal sagittal dimension. The hepatic parenchyma demonstrates homogeneous echotexture, with normal echogenicity. No focal liver lesions identified. There is no evidence of intrahepatic ductal dilation. The common bile duct has a dilated caliber, measuring 9 mm, small echogenic stones are seen in the distal duct. Multiple calcified stones are noted within the gallbladder lumen. No wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid identified. The patient was not focally tender over the gallbladder.  The portal vein is patent with normal hepatopetal flow. The upper abdominal aorta has normal caliber, measuring 1.8 cm, and appears unremarkable. The visualized portions of the IVC are unremarkable on grayscale imaging. A 1.1 cm anechoic lesion is noted within the pancreatic head, likely representing a side branch IPMN.  The main pancreatic duct has normal caliber measuring 3 mm within the pancreatic head. The distal body and tail is obscured secondary to artifact from overlying bowel gas. The right kidney is normal in size, measuring 9.2 cm in length. The renal parenchyma demonstrates normal cortical thickness and echogenicity. No nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis identified.  No abdominal free fluid identified.
