The liver surface is nodular, compatible with cirrhosis.. There is no evidence of intrahepatic ductal dilation. The proximal common bile duct has normal  caliber, measuring 4mm.

The portal vein is patent with reversed flow. Visualized portion of the pancreas is normal. The right kidney measures 12cm with normal echogenicity.There is no evidence of stone or hydronephrosis.
